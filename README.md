# mac_address_random_changer
This is a bash script to change your M.A.C address randomly. 
I personally use it when I get blocked by my school network
(the network on our campus usually detects false alarms about malwares and it blocks by M.A.C address and then it takes time to apply to unblock it, so I just change the address to solve that. )

to use this script, download it to your local directory, cd to the directory it is in.
type "chmod 777 " followed by the script name.
then type "./" followed by the script name.
